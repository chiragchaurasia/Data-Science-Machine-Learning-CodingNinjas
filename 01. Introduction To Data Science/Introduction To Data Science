1. Data Science
  ðŸ‘‰Data Science is the study from where we collect valuable data, what this data represents & how we turn this valuable resource in the creation of different strategies (Business), increases efficiencies.
  ðŸ‘‰Backed by Machine Learning & its algorithms for the analysis.
  ðŸ‘‰Data Science is the process of using data to find solutions to predict outcomes for the problem Statement.
  ðŸ‘‰Data Science is a multifaceted discipline of everything to do with data.

2. Work of Data Scientist
  ðŸ‘‰Understand the problem
  ðŸ‘‰Collect enough data (Files, Database, API & web scraping)
  ðŸ‘‰API[Programming Interface] (Google - Maps - User), Web Scrapping (means extract data from web.)
  ðŸ‘‰Process and clean data
  ðŸ‘‰Explore and visualize data
  ðŸ‘‰Analyse data using ML
  ðŸ‘‰Communicate the result

3. Data Science & Machine Learning (ML)
  ðŸ‘‰Machine Learning make our machine capable of learning by their own. ie. without being explicitly programmed.

  ðŸ‘‰Artificial Intelligence (or AI)
    Artificial Intelligence tries to make computers intelligent in order to minic the cognitive functions of humans. So it is a general field with a broad scope including: Computer Vision, Language Processing, Creativity, and Summarization.

  ðŸ‘‰Machine Learning (or ML)
    Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers the statistical part of Artificial Intelligence, which teaches the computer to solve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples, learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations.

  ðŸ‘‰Deep Learning (or DL)
    Deep Learning is a very special field of Machine Learning where computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own. It involves a deeper level of automation in comparison with most machine learning algorithms.

4. Libraries
